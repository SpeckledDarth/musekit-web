# MuseKit.io - Project Overview

> **Revision:** 5.0 | **Last Updated:** February 20, 2026 | **Created:** February 2026

**A SaaS Starter Template for Rapid Product Launch**

---

## What is MuseKit?

MuseKit is a ready-to-use foundation for building software-as-a-service (SaaS) products. Think of it as a "starter kit" that handles all the common features every online business needs—user accounts, payments, team management, admin dashboards—so you can focus on building what makes your product unique.

Instead of spending months building login systems, payment processing, and admin tools from scratch, MuseKit gives you these out of the box. You clone it, customize it, and launch your product in days instead of months.

### MuseKit vs. PassivePost

MuseKit and PassivePost are **two distinct sides** of this project:

| | **MuseKit** (The Template) | **PassivePost** (The First Product) |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | A reusable SaaS starter template | An AI social media scheduling tool |
| **Who uses it** | Developers building new SaaS products | Solopreneurs and gig workers |
| **Purpose** | Provides auth, billing, admin, email, etc. | Manages social media posts with AI |
| **Code location** | Everything outside `/social/` directories | Everything inside `/social/` directories |
| **Database** | `migrations/core/` | `migrations/extensions/` |
| **Can be removed?** | No — it's the foundation | Yes — delete `/social/` dirs to remove |

PassivePost proves the MuseKit extension model works. For full PassivePost details, see `docs/passivepost/PRODUCT_GUIDE.md`.

## The Problem It Solves

### For Entrepreneurs and Developers

Building a SaaS product from scratch means solving the same problems everyone else has already solved:

- **User authentication** - How do people sign up and log in?
- **Subscription billing** - How do you charge customers monthly?
- **Team features** - How do organizations manage multiple users?
- **Admin controls** - How do you manage users and see analytics?
- **Email notifications** - How do you send welcome emails and updates?
- **SEO and marketing pages** - How do you get found on Google?

These features take 3-6 months to build properly. Most projects never get past this "infrastructure phase" to the actual product idea.

### The MuseKit Solution

MuseKit provides all of this pre-built, tested, and production-ready. You inherit months of development work on day one, letting you jump straight to building your unique value proposition.

---

## Who Is This For?

### Primary Users

1. **Solo Founders** - Technical or semi-technical entrepreneurs who want to validate ideas quickly without rebuilding infrastructure every time.

2. **Small Development Teams** - Teams who want a consistent, proven foundation for multiple SaaS projects.

3. **Agencies** - Development agencies who build SaaS products for clients and need a reliable starting point.

### Use Cases

- **Launch a new SaaS product** - Start with everything you need, add your unique features
- **Clone for multiple products** - Use the same template for different business ideas
- **Learn modern SaaS architecture** - See how authentication, billing, and multi-tenancy work together

---

## How It Works (Simplified)

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technologies | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Vercel + Next.js 16+ + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS | Modern React framework with server-side rendering, beautiful UI components, and utility-first styling |
| **Backend/API** | Next.js API Routes + OAuth SDKs | Serverless API endpoints with authentication provider integrations |
| **Database/Storage** | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage + Auth) | Managed database, file storage, and built-in authentication with Row Level Security |
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth + 5 OAuth Providers | Email/password, Google, GitHub, Apple, Twitter/X OAuth, and Magic Link passwordless |
| **AI & Automation** | xAI Grok API + n8n | AI capabilities and workflow automation |
| **Operations** | Resend (Emails) + Sentry (Monitoring) + Plausible (Analytics) + Upstash/BullMQ (Queues) | Transactional emails, error tracking, privacy-friendly metrics, and background job processing |
| **Queue & Rate Limiting** | Upstash Redis + BullMQ | Background job processing (6 core + 4 social job types) and API rate limiting |
| **Monetization** | Stripe | Subscription billing, payment processing, and customer portal |

### Authentication & OAuth

MuseKit supports multiple authentication methods:

| Method | Status | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Email/Password | Included | Enabled | Traditional signup with email verification |
| Google OAuth | Included | Enabled | One-click sign-in with Google accounts |
| GitHub OAuth | Included | Disabled | One-click sign-in with GitHub accounts |
| Apple OAuth | Included | Disabled | One-click sign-in with Apple accounts |
| Twitter/X OAuth | Included | Disabled | One-click sign-in with X accounts |
| Magic Links | Included | Enabled | Passwordless email authentication |
| SSO/SAML | Included | Disabled | Enterprise single sign-on via Supabase SAML |

**Admin Controls:** All OAuth providers can be enabled/disabled via the Setup Dashboard (Features tab). Changes take effect immediately on login/signup pages - no code changes required.

### The Workflow

1. **Clone the template** - Copy MuseKit to your own repository
2. **Connect services** - Link your Supabase, Stripe, and Resend accounts
3. **Customize branding** - Set your app name, colors, and logo
4. **Configure pricing** - Define your subscription tiers
5. **Build your features** - Add what makes your product unique
6. **Deploy** - Push to Vercel and go live

### Multi-Tenancy

MuseKit supports multiple organizations using the same codebase. Each organization:
- Has its own members and data
- Can have custom branding
- Is isolated from other organizations

This means you can run multiple SaaS products from one template, or allow customers to create their own "workspaces" within your product.

### Database Extension Pattern

MuseKit supports a clean extension model for building products on top of the template:
- **Core tables** live in `migrations/core/` and are never modified by extensions
- **Extension tables** live in `migrations/extensions/` and add product-specific schemas
- This ensures clean template cloning — extensions can be included or excluded per product
- PassivePost is the first product built using this pattern, proving the model works
- See `docs/musekit/ADDING_A_PRODUCT.md` for how to build your own product on MuseKit

## Why MuseKit Was Built

### The Vision

Every SaaS idea deserves a fair chance. But too many good ideas die in the "infrastructure swamp" -- the months spent building login pages and payment forms before you can even test if anyone wants your product.

MuseKit exists to eliminate that barrier. With a production-ready foundation, founders can:

- **Validate faster** - Get to market in days, not months
- **Iterate quickly** - Spend time on features, not infrastructure
- **Scale confidently** - Built on proven, battle-tested architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Production-ready** - Not a tutorial or demo; real code you can ship
2. **Modern stack** - Uses current best practices and popular tools
3. **Flexible** - Customize everything; no vendor lock-in
4. **Well-documented** - Clear guides for setup and customization
5. **Maintainable** - Clean architecture that grows with your product
6. **Extensible** - Database extension pattern for building products on top
